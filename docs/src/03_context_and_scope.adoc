== Context and Scope
This section describes the system boundary: the communication partners (users and external systems),
the domain-level inputs and outputs, and the technical channels used for interaction. It separates
business context (who interacts with the system and what domain information is exchanged) from
technical context (protocols, ports, and runtime deployment aspects).

Motivation: clear context and scope prevent misunderstandings about responsibilities, interfaces,
and deployment requirements.

==== Elements Description
* **Player**: The end-user who interacts with the system through a web browser to play games and view statistics.
* **Administrator**: Responsible for managing users and monitoring the system.
* **Bot**: An automated agent that can interact with the game engine to play games and view user stats.
* **WebApp**: The front-end application built with React and Vite, serving the user interface and handling user interactions.
* **Users**: The back-end service responsible for user authentication and management, built with Node.js.
* **Gamey**: The game engine and bot service implemented in Rust, responsible for game logic and interactions with bots.
* **DB**: The database used to persist user data and games.

.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

' --- External interactions ---
Browser --> Proxy : HTTPS (443) / HTTP (80)
Browser --> WebApp : HTTP (dev 5173)
Admin --> Users : HTTPS (3000) - admin API
ExternalBot --> Gamey : HTTPS JSON (4000) - bot API

' --- Internal service communication ---
Proxy --> WebApp : HTTP (internal)
WebApp --> Users : HTTP JSON (REST)
WebApp --> Gamey : HTTP JSON (REST)
Users --> DB : TCP (DB driver)
Gamey --> DB : TCP (DB driver)

' --- Monitoring ---
Users --> Prometheus : HTTP /metrics
Gamey --> Prometheus : HTTP /metrics
Prometheus --> Grafana : HTTP (data source)

note left of DB
DB runs in a container with a mounted persistent volume.
end note

note right of Proxy
TLS termination and certificate management here.
In development Vite serves on 5173 directly.
end note

note bottom
Internal Docker network; only expose the reverse proxy in production.

.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking the system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
