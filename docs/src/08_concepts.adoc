== Cross-cutting Concepts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]

.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

This section describes the fundamental concepts, architectural principles, and technical decisions that apply across multiple components of the system.
These concepts ensure architectural consistency, reduce complexity, and support the system’s long-term evolution.

=== _<Concept 1>_

Domain Concepts

The domain of the system is centered around user management and Game Y execution.

Key domain concepts include:

 - User: A registered client of the system.

 - Game: A Game Y match, either active or completed.

 - Player: An entity participating in a game (human or automated).

 - Bot: An automated player controlled by the game engine.

 - Move / Action: A single action performed during gameplay.

 - Game State: The current state of a game.

 - User Profile: Persisted information associated with a user.



=== _<Concept 2>_
Architecture and Design Patterns

The system follows a service-oriented and layered architecture, applying the following principles:

- Client–Server Architecture
    The web application acts as a client, while backend services act as servers.

- Separation of Concerns
    Each component has a clearly defined responsibility:

     - Webapp: User interaction and presentation

     - Users Service: User management and persistence

     - Gamey: Game logic and bot execution

 - API-first Design
    All communication between components is performed through HTTP-based APIs.

This approach ensures loose coupling and enables independent evolution of components.


=== _<Concept 3>_

Security Concepts

The system implements basic security concepts, appropriate for a development or educational environment:

 - No authentication or authorization mechanisms are currently enforced.

 - No sensitive credentials are stored.

 - Database access is restricted to the Users Service.

 - Services communicate within a trusted internal network.

 - Security considerations are intentionally simplified to keep the architectural focus on modularity and clarity.


=== _<Concept 4>_
Development Concepts

Development follows these principles:

 - Each service can be built, tested, and run independently.

 - Clear interface contracts define inter-service communication.

 - Technology choices are isolated per component.

This enables parallel development and easier maintenance.

=== _<Concept 5>_
Operational Concepts

From an operational perspective:

 - The system is primarily designed for local and development environments.

 - Services are started and stopped as a group.

 - Logs are written to standard output.

 - No monitoring or automated scaling is currently implemented.

The operational model favors simplicity and transparency over production-level optimization.
