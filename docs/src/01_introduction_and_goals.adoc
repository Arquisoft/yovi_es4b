==  Introduction and Goals

YOVI is an online game based on Game Y, an abstract strategy board game described by John Milnor in the 1950's and indepently invented in 1953 by Craige Schensted and Charles Titus. +
The game is normally played on a triangular board by two players, whose goal is to connect the three sides of the board with an unbroken chain of their pieces. +
YOVI is a modern implementation of Game Y, which allows players to play against bots of varying dificulties, against other players locally or online. It also features a login system, allowing it to log accounts' stats.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

|===
|Priority|Quality Goal|Description
|1|Robustness|The game should be able to handle unexpected inputs and situations without crashing or producing incorrect results. This includes handling invalid moves, network interruptions, and other unforeseen circumstances gracefully. |
2|Usability|The game should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows players to easily navigate through menus, understand game mechanics, and enjoy a seamless gaming experience.|
3|Performance|The game should run smoothly with minimal latency, especially in online multiplayer mode, to ensure a responsive and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.|
4|Compatibility|The game should be compatible with any type of device that has a web browser, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, to reach a wide audience of players.|
5|Security|The game should implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access, especially in the context of user accounts and online multiplayer interactions.

The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
