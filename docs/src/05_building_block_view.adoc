== 5. Building Block View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block,but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

image::05_level1_yovi.png["General View - System Boundary"]

Motivation::

This first view shows the system at its highest abstraction level.
It defines the system boundary (`Yovi`) and the external actor (`Usuario`) before introducing internal decomposition.
This helps stakeholders understand scope and ownership before going into technical details.


Contained Building Blocks::
+
* `Yovi`: Main system boundary that contains the application internals, detailed in the next levels.

Important Interfaces::
+
* `Usuario -> Yovi`: Primary interaction interface between the end user and the system.

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.

==== Yovi

System boundary that provides gameplay capabilities to the user and is internally decomposed in the following levels.



=== Level 2

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

endif::arc42help[]

==== White Box _Yovi_

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
...describes the internal structure of _building block 1_.
****
endif::arc42help[]

image::05_level2_yovi.png["Level 2 - Yovi Main Decomposition"]

Motivation::
Level 2 decomposes `Yovi` into its main runtime building blocks while keeping implementation details hidden.
This view clarifies responsibilities between presentation, backend logic, and persistence.

Contained Building Blocks::
+
* `WebApp`: Frontend used by the player for interaction.
* `Backend`: Server-side component that exposes business operations.
* `BBDD`: Persistent storage used by backend services.

Important Interfaces::
+
* `Usuario -> WebApp`: User interaction interface.
* `WebApp -> Backend`: HTTP/JSON application interface.
* `Backend -> BBDD`: Persistence access interface.




=== Level 3

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.

==== White Box _Backend_

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Specifies the internal structure of _building block x.1_.
****
endif::arc42help[]

image::05_level3_yovi.png["Level 3 - Backend Internal Decomposition"]

Motivation::
Level 3 details the internal structure of the backend component.
It isolates the key business services and their collaboration for user and gameplay operations.

Contained Building Blocks::
+
* `User`: Service responsible for user-related operations.
* `Gamey`: Service responsible for game engine and game logic.
* `BBDD`: Shared persistence component used by backend services.

Important Interfaces::
+
* `User <--> Gamey`: Internal service-to-service interface for game/user data exchange.
* `User -> BBDD`: User data persistence interface.
* `Gamey -> BBDD`: Game state persistence interface.
