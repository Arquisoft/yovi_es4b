== Risks and Technical Debts

Identifying and recording technical risks and debts at an early stage is essential for the project's success.
By identifying potential issues ahead of time, the team can take appropriate measures to minimize their impact. 
Prioritizing these risks ensures that the most critical ones are addressed first, allowing for better planning
and a more stable and maintainable architecture.

.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.


.Further Information

=== Technical Risks

This table lists the main technical risks for our online board game project, including both team-related and system-related risks, ordered by priority.

[options="header"]
|===
| Priority | Risk | Description | Mitigation

| High
| Team members abandoning the project
| One or more team members leave the project in the middle of development, increasing workload for remaining members.
| Ensure code is well documented and modular, redistribute tasks, and maintain clear progress tracking.

| High
| Poor or limited communication within the team
| Misunderstandings and delays occur due to a lack of communication between team members.
| Hold regular meetings with clear minutes; use task boards and messaging tools to achieve constant communication.

| High
| Limited experience with large-scale projects
| The team has little prior experience working on projects from scratch or with multiple contributors.
| Conduct research, review best practices, and define clear development workflows and responsibilities.

| Medium
| Limited experience with Rust
| The project uses Rust, which is new to the team members, potentially causing delays or inefficient code.
| Each team member should independently study Rust and experiment with small prototypes to build competence.

| Medium
| Lack of experience with Docker
| Docker is used for deployment and development environments, but the team is not familiar with it.
| Set up step-by-step guides and practice building containers.

| Medium
| Database performance or schema issues
| As users increase, the database may slow down or be difficult to scale due to initial design choices.
| Optimize queries, define indexes, and design the schema for future scalability.

| Medium
| Third-party API failures
| Some game functionalities rely on external APIs, which may become unavailable.
| Implement caching, evaluate fallback APIs, and provide error handling to minimize disruption.

| Low
| High concurrent usage
| Many players using the system simultaneously may degrade performance or affect game state consistency.
| Conduct load testing, use caching, and optimize backend services.
