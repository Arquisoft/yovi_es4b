.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.

Architecture Decisions

This section documents the most relevant architectural decisions made during the design of the system.
Each decision includes context, alternatives, rationale, and consequences to ensure traceability and transparency.

ADR-01: Adoption of a Service-Oriented Architecture

    Status

        Accepted

    Context

        The system consists of three main functional areas:

            User interface (Webapp)

            User management

            Game engine logic

            These areas could be implemented either as a single monolithic application or as independent services.

    Decision

        The system is implemented as a set of loosely coupled services, each running independently and communicating via HTTP APIs.

    Alternatives Considered

        Monolithic architecture

        Service-oriented (multi-container) architecture

    Rationale

        The service-oriented approach was selected because:

            It enforces clear separation of concerns.

            It allows independent development and testing.

            It aligns with container-based deployment.

            It improves maintainability and scalability.

    Consequences

        Positive:

            Independent evolution of components.

            Clear API contracts.

            Better modularity.

        Negative:

            Increased deployment complexity.

            Network communication overhead.



ADR-02: Use of Container-Based Deployment

    Status

        Accepted

    Context

        The system needs to be executable in development environments and easily portable across machines.

    Decision

        All services are deployed using containerization and orchestrated together.

        Alternatives Considered

        Native execution on host machine

        Containerized execution

    Rationale

        Containerization ensures:

            Environment consistency.

            Dependency isolation.

            Simplified onboarding.

            Infrastructure reproducibility.

    Consequences

        Positive:

            Predictable deployments.

            Technology independence per service.

        Negative:

            Slight overhead compared to native execution.



ADR-03: Introduction of a Dedicated Persistence Layer for Users

    Status

        Accepted

    Context

        To support real user management, persistent storage is required.

    Decision

        A dedicated database component is introduced for storing user data.
        The database is accessed exclusively through a persistence layer inside the Users Service.

    Alternatives Considered

        In-memory user storage

        File-based storage

    Rationale

        A database-based solution was chosen because:

        It provides durability and consistency.

        It enables long-term user management.

        It allows future extension (authentication, statistics, etc.).

        It enforces architectural separation between services.


    Consequences

        Positive:

            Persistent user data.

            Improved scalability.

            Clear data ownership (Users Service).

        Negative:

            Additional infrastructure component.

            Need for connection management and data modeling.


ADR-04: Separation of Game Logic from User Management

    Status

        Accepted

    Context

        The system includes both user registration and game execution logic.

    Decision

    T   he Gamey engine remains fully independent from user persistence and user management.

    Rationale

        Ensures single responsibility per service.

        Allows the game engine to be reused in other contexts.

        Prevents unnecessary coupling between domain areas.

    Consequences

        Positive:

            Clear domain boundaries.

            Higher reusability.

            Easier testing.

        Negative:

            Requires API coordination between services.
