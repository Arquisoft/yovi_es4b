== Architecture Decisions

.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.

=== ADR-001: Documentation Language

==== Status

Accepted

==== Context

The project yovi_es4b is developed at Universidad de Oviedo (Spain) as part of an academic course (es4b). As such, team members are Spanish speakers. However, the project aims to follow software industry best practices and may be reviewed by international collaborators or serve as a portfolio piece.

We need to decide on a consistent language for all project documentation, including:

* README files
* Code comments
* Architecture documentation (Arc42)
* API documentation
* Commit messages
* Issue and pull request descriptions

==== Decision

**All project documentation will be written in English.**

This includes:

* Main README.md and all component READMEs
* Arc42 architecture documentation (docs/)
* Code comments and inline documentation
* API documentation generated by tools (JSDoc, cargo doc, etc.)
* Git commit messages
* Technical documentation in general

**Exception:** Internal team communication (issues, pull requests, meeting notes) may be in Spanish if all team members prefer it for efficiency.

==== Consequences

*Positive:*

* Follows industry standard practices
* Makes the project accessible to international developers
* Improves team members' technical English skills
* Allows the project to serve as a portfolio piece
* Facilitates integration with English-language tools and frameworks
* Arc42 template is well-established in English

*Negative:*

* May slow down initial documentation writing as Spanish speakers translate thoughts
* Some Spanish-specific domain concepts may be harder to express
* Team members must maintain proficiency in technical English

*Neutral:*

* Existing documentation is already in English, so no translation effort is needed
* Team communication can remain flexible based on team preference
